# CNN Courseworks and Hobby Projects Repository

## Homework 3

This repository contains my coursework and hobby projects related to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The focus of Homework 3 is on two main parts:

### Part 1: Layerwise Learning on VGG11

In the first part of this project, I implemented layerwise learning on the VGG11 architecture. The objective was to compare its performance with feed-forward and backpropagation learning methods. This analysis provides insights into the effectiveness of layerwise learning in the context of VGG11.

### Part 2: Segmentation Networks - U-Net and PSPNet Implementation

The second part of the homework involves the training of two popular segmentation networks:

#### U-Net Implementation
I have implemented the U-Net architecture for image segmentation. U-Net is known for its success in biomedical image segmentation and has applications in various domains.

#### PSPNet Implementation
In this part, I implemented the PSPNet (Pyramid Scene Parsing Network) for semantic segmentation. The architecture utilizes pyramid pooling modules to capture contextual information at different scales.
