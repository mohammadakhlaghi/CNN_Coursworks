# CNN Courseworks

This repository contains my coursework and hobby projects related to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Explore different projects and their code within the respective folders.

## Homework 3

Homework 3 focuses on two main parts:

### Part 1: Layerwise Learning on VGG11

Implementation of layerwise learning on the VGG11 architecture, comparing its performance with feed-forward and backpropagation learning methods.

### Part 2: Segmentation Networks - U-Net and PSPNet Implementation

Training of two popular segmentation networks:

#### U-Net Implementation
Implementation of the U-Net architecture for image segmentation, known for its success in biomedical image segmentation and applications in various domains.

#### PSPNet Implementation
Implementation of the PSPNet (Pyramid Scene Parsing Network) for semantic segmentation. The architecture utilizes pyramid pooling modules to capture contextual information at different scales.

## RCNN

In the RCNN part, we used the Faster-RCNN network on the PASCAL dataset and achieved excellent results. The "RCNN" folder includes:
- `Faster_RCNN.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for Faster-RCNN implementation.
- `RCNN.pdf`: Persian report on the RCNN project.
